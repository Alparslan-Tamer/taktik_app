# taktik_app - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
It will be an application where students can follow their studies for the exam;

- They will be able to record how many questions they solve from which subject with their time on a daily basis.

- They will be able to make a general statistical analysis of these records at any time and identify their shortcomings.

- If they wish, the application will automatically learn their deficiencies by pressing a button thanks to the AI model and create a study plan for those deficiencies.
